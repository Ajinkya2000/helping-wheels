# Helping Wheels

### Problem we tried to solve
In the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic, health infrastructure has collapsed and the number of ambulances is limited. Moreover, rents of ambulances have risen at an exponential rate especially in the private sector making it impossible to afford for a majority of country’s population.  Many deaths have happened due to either because the ambulances arrived late or didn’t arrive at all. At the same time, there are people among us are willing to lend their hand by providing their own vehicles or even driven to the hospital. Helping Wheels is a platform that will facilitate the communication between these two. Anyone who is in a medical emergency can ask for help through our website and our willing volunteers around the area will get an email with the information of the concern person along with their contact number and address. The patient would see these volunteers on the map and can contact them too!
